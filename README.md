# DataVisualization

In machine learning, while working on any type of data, we need data visualization. Before deciding what model to use or telling which algorithm will work better, we have to visualize the data we have. Also, after training and testing, we need data visualization to explain our thoughts better.

Plotly is a great tool that helps us to visualize data better and with comfort. There are variety of plots available in plotly. Also, we can edit and create plots online on there plotly studio.
